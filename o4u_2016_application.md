# O4U Application 2016

Below is an excerpt of my application to Out 4 Undergrad in 2016, when I was a junior in college.

```
What is an interest or passion of yours, unrelated to being LGBTQ or your
explicit career goals?

My parents never signed me up for dance lessons as a kid, but since early high
school, I've had an interest in hip hop dance. I'll be the first one to admit
that I'm not the best, and while I haven't found the biggest community in high
school in Michigan or in college at Yale, there's something about it that has
drawn me through the years. I think it's something about being able to play
into the character of the choreography without having to worry about whether it
fits an image of myself, or how others see me. With hip hop, it's okay to let
loose from the academic environment around me to play into different
personalities of the choregraphy. It's okay to jam to Chief Keef without
sticking out as the butch lesbian, and it's okay to explore femininity in the
next Beyonce song. It's not just about an internal exploration, because as a
performing art, it asks for the attention of an audience and it says to them
"I want you to see me like this!" I like that there's absolutely no hiding and
that it builds up a certain confidence in me from being on stage asking to be
the center of somebody's scrutiny.

I think there are two notable things about this excerpt, when I compare who I was when I wrote this with who I am now.

One, that the imposter syndrome that I used to have with dance is quite evident here. In answering a question about my passion, I was so quick to give a disclaimer of the legitimacy of my interest, as if someone was going to background check me for my qualifications. It'll take me another two years from when I wrote this to recognize the irony of having imposter sydrome about being a dancer in my application to a tech conference: imposter syndrome is so widely discussed in tech with respect to academics and career, and yet it never dawned on me that I'd be having that exact experience with dance.

Two, I still feel as strongly about this particular reason of why I love dance. My thoughts above glaze over the relationship between gender performance and dance, but I want to emphasize them now. People often have some sort of expectation of my masculinity as an androgynous girl, as if it's in order to overcompensate others' expecations of my femininity, but what they don't understand is how that can be suffocating as well. Dance is truly a safe space for me to put on a figurative face of makeup, and do whatever the fuck I want. I love that no one bats an eye when our dance performance is not aligned with how we present ourselves, a manifestation of how we see ourselves, or representative of what careers we pursue.
